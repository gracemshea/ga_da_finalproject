# Raw Data Sources:
1. [Population](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2017/demo/popest/total-cities-and-towns.html#ds) Under Datasets, I selected United States. For this ranking, only 2017 estimates were utilized, as will be made clear in the data cleaning.
2. [Zillow Home Value Index](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/) Under Home Values, I selected ZHVI and City.
3. [Campgrounds](http://www.uscampgrounds.info/takeit.html) Download files at bottom of the page, excluding Canada file.
4. [Recreational Fishing](https://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/recreational-fisheries/data-and-documentation/queries/index) Utilize the query tool to retrieve catch data. For the purposes of this project I focused on total catch by location for the year 2018.
