# Best Places for Outdoor Enthusiasts

## Introduction 
This project, which performs a ranking of the best American cities for outdoors enthusiasts, showcases my SQL skills using a combination of [data sources](https://github.com/gracemshea/ga_da_finalproject/blob/master/datasources.md). These files consist of Zillow's Home Value Index, U.S. city population estimates, NOAA's registered recreational fishing catches for 2017, as well as the locations of city bike lanes, campgrounds, climbing routes, and ski resorts across the United States.

From data collection to the final product, I utilized Excel to clean and format the raw data, SQL to load, organize and transform it within Postgres, and Tableau to analyze the data and enable user input for an individualized final ranking of locations. 

## Excel: Data Cleaning Process, Pivot Tables & VLOOKUP

### Data Cleaning Process

When cleaning the datasets, I eliminated columns of data unnecessary to my project. For example, in the fish catch dataset, there were many columns that were not important to my question; Where were people catching fish recreationally in the U.S. and what were the catch totals? However, not all data cleaning comes from **elimination**, but rather **adding** columns to make the data easier to understand.

### VLOOKUP

 + Example 1: The fishing data referred to the US states by numbers, using the FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standard) state codes. I added a second tab with these codes and used a VLOOKUP function to fill in the state names into the dataset. See here.
 
 + Example 2: The camping data referred to the campsite type with a code. I found these codes on the main campground info website, and created a second tab in Excel with the codes and corresponding meanings. By using VLOOKUP, I integrated the campground types into the dataset. See here.
