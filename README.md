# ga_da_finalproject
Grace Shea's Final Project Repo for DA class @ GA

This project to showcase SQL, Excel, and Tableau skills using a combination of public data from Zillow and the City of Seattle. 

This README is in progress. Topics being explored with SQL queries and pivot tables are the following:

1. Rent prices and home sales in the Seattle area compared to other major metropolitan cities with land restrictions due to water (2010-2018). This may just mean New York City, but we'll see.
2. Forecast future rent prices and home sales in the Seattle area. See if there is any way to forecast economic development southward towards Tacoma.
3. Build additional visualizations to demonstrate changing industry landscape within Seattle as well as changes in population demographics.

If I could answer one question it would be what Tacoma will be like in 10 years time.
