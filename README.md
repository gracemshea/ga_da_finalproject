# Best Places for Outdoor Enthusiasts

## Introduction 
This project, which performs a ranking of the best American cities for outdoors enthusiasts, showcases my SQL skills using a combination of [data sources](https://github.com/gracemshea/ga_da_finalproject/blob/master/datasources.md). These files consist of Zillow's Home Value Index, U.S. city population estimates, NOAA's registered recreational fishing catches for 2017, as well as the locations of city bike lanes, campgrounds, climbing routes, and ski resorts across the United States.

From data collection to the final product, I utilized Excel to clean and format the raw data, SQL to load, organize and transform it within Postgres, and Tableau to analyze the data and enable user input for an individualized final ranking of locations.

###Data Cleaning Process

When cleaning the datasets, I eliminated columns of data unnecessary to my project. For example, in the fish catch dataset, there were many columns that were not important to my question; Where were people catching fish recreationally in the U.S. and what were the catch totals? However, not all data cleaning comes from **elimination**, but rather **adding** columns to make the data easier to understand.
